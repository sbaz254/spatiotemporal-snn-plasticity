# spatiotemporal-snn-plasticity
Spiking neural network simulation using NEST to explore how repeated spatiotemporal stimulation shapes synaptic connectivity through plasticity. 

This repository contains the implementation of my MSc Artificial Intelligence & Adaptive Systems thesis project, which investigates how repetitive spatiotemporal input patterns influence the formation and reorganisation of synaptic connections in grid-based spiking neural networks.
